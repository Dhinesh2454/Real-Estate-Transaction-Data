# Real-Estate-Transaction-Data(Chennai)
Project Objective
The goal of this project is to preprocess and analyze a real estate transaction dataset to extract meaningful insights. This dataset contains various features related to the sale of properties, such as the sale price, property characteristics, date of sale, and other features that could impact property value. By preprocessing the data, we aim to prepare it for analysis and predictive modeling, focusing on identifying trends, understanding property price dynamics, and predicting property prices based on key features.
